</div><div class="popUpscroll"><p>Below are some tips to help you find and remove the Rogue APs running the Rogue<br />WiFi networks.
</p><p> 
</p><div class="troubleGuide"><div>Know your ports:
</div><span>A Rogue AP can be plugged into any open port on any piece of your networking equipment. This can include your router, a network switch, or even the port on a wall of your premises! This is the first place you should look to find the Rogue AP.</span></div><div class="troubleGuide"><div>Ask around:
</div>Your employees are the most likely to have plugged an AP into your network. Calmly ask them if they brought in an AP from home and where they hooked it up. They probably don't realize why this is bad, so be nice!
</div><div class="troubleGuide"><div>Confirm:
</div>If you believe you found the Rogue AP, confirm by looking at its MAC Address (typically found on the label on the back of the AP) and comparing it to the one on the alert page. If you cannot locate it, identify who made the AP and compare that to the AP Vendor listed on the alert page.
</div><div class="troubleGuide"><div>Unplug:
</div>The only way to remove the threat of a Rogue AP is to completely remove it from the network. Disconnect the AP from the port and power it down.

</div><div id="divGuideContainer" class="popUpscroll"><p>Below are some handy definitions for terms featured throughout this app:
</p><p> 
</p><div class="guide_collapsible"><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">Access Point (AP)
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">An Access Point, commonly referred to as "AP", is a device used to provide a WiFi network that WiFi clients can connect to for Internet access.
</div><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">Active WiFi
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">The term "Active WiFi" refers to any WiFi network deployed by you that is currently powered on in your premises and associated WiFi clients.
</div><!-- <h2 id="refGuideCampaign" ng-click="collapsible($event);">Campaigns</h2>
            <div class="collapsibleContent">'Campaigns' is an app that allows you to engage with your guest WiFi users. <br/>
                    Splash and landing pages comprise onsite guest engagement campaigns.</div> --><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">Client
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">The term "Client" is commonly used to describe WiFi enabled devices such as smartphones, tablets and laptops.
</div><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">DHCP
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). When DHCP is turned on, the WiFi network assigns an IP address, from a pool of pre-defined IP addresses, to each client that connects. A client needs an IP address to communicate over the WiFi network.
</div><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">Guest WiFi
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">The term "Guest WiFi" refers to any Guest WiFi network deployed by you and associated WiFi clients.
</div><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">MAC Address
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">A MAC Address is a unique identifier used by WiFi clients and APs. In the case of APs you can typically find it on the label on the back of an AP. It will be 12 characters long using numerals 0-9 and letters A-F.
</div><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">Port
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">A port is where you plug in an AP to connect to the network. Ports are typically found on the back of your router, switch, or even on the wall.
</div><!-- <h2 id="refGuidePortal" ng-click="collapsible($event);">Portal</h2>
            <div class="collapsibleContent">A portal desc will come here.</div> --><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">Private WiFi
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">The term "Private WiFi" refers to WiFi networks you create for trusted users. Such networks should only be used by WiFi clients that belong to you or your business, and should always be secured with a strong password.
</div><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">PSK (Pre-Shared Key)
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">A PSK or Pre-Shared Key is the password used to connect to a private WiFi network and should have a minimum length of 8 characters.
</div><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">Rogue WiFi
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">The term "Rogue WiFi" refers to any WiFi network originating from an unauthorized AP that is connected to your network. Such an AP is called a Rogue AP. You might not have installed it, but its presence on the network can create a risk of a security breach. For any Rogue WiFi network that is found, it is strongly recommended that the corresponding Rogue AP is unplugged from the network. Clients associated with a Rogue WiFi network are called Rogue clients.
</div><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">Security Mode
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">The Security Mode is the type of password used for a WiFi network; it can be WPA2 PSK, WPA2/WPA PSK, or Open (i.e., no password). Open is often used for Guest networks to provide easy access to guests; however, Private networks must always be secured with a password (WPA2 or WPA2/WPA PSK).
</div><h2 ng-click="collapsible($event);">Trusted WiFi
</h2><div class="collapsibleContent">The term "Trusted WiFi" refers to any Private WiFi network deployed by you and associated WiFi clients.
